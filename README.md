# Compose State Events Library Sample Project
This project is meant to be as an addition to my [Medium article](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-handle-viewmodel-one-time-events-in-jetpack-compose-a01af0678b76) about the [Compose-State-Events library](https://github.com/leonard-palm/compose-state-events).

If you don't like reading articles, you can also check out my [Youtube video about the library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRtF86uWqg).
